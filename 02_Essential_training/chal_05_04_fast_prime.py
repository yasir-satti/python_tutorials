# Faster Prime FindingÂ¶
# Write a function that returns a list of all primes up to a given number.

# For each number, in order to determine if it is prime, take the following steps:

# Find the square root of the number
# Find all the primes up to that square root
# Test to see if any of those primes are divisors
# If a number has no prime divisors, it is prime!

def allPrimesUpTo(num):
    primes = [2]
    for number in range(3, num):
        sqrtNum = number**0.5
        for factor in primes:
            if number % factor == 0:
                # Not prime
                break
            if factor > sqrtNum:
                # It's prime!
                primes.append(number)
                break
    return primes

print(allPrimesUpTo(50))
